    <p>I come from down in the valley.</p>
    <p>where mister, when you're young</p>
    <p>They bring you up to do like your daddy done</p>
    <p>Me and Mary we met in high school</p>
    <p>When she was just seventeen</p>
    <p>We'd ride out of this valley down</p>
    <p>To where the fields were green</p>
    <br>
    <p>We'd go down to the river</p>
    <p>And into the river we'd dive</p>
    <p>Oh, down to the river we'd ride</p>
